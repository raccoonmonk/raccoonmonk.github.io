This list will help you to roughly estimate amount of time and costs for the port task.\\n\\n### Machine running macOS\\n\\nGet a macOS. It can be possibly virtual. Here\'s a popular project that looks really promising <https://github.com/kholia/OSX-KVM>. Again, having a physical Apple machine is not mendatory. But of course it is recommended by Apple. At least license-wise.\\n\\n### Xcode with command line tools\\n\\nInstall Xcode. You can find all versions of Xcode here <https://stackoverflow.com/a/10335943>. Those are just a collection of links. The actual files are hosted on Apple servers. To download them you will need to log into your Apple Developer Account.\\n\\n### macOS and Qt versions\\n\\nMake sure that your macOS version and Xcode version are supported by Qt <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/supported-platforms.html>. You can start porting with building your project on the initial platform but with Clang and up-to-date Qt version.\\n\\n### Qt libraries\\n\\nGet Qt libraries. There is no need to build Qt by yourself. It takes a lot of time and can be challenging. Obtaining Qt through online installer is absolutely acceptable <https://download.qt.io/archive/online_installers/>. It is good on Linux and Windows too. It is easy to update in future and helps to avoid conflicts in system. Even better now since Qt became relocatable <https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-is-relocatable>.\\n\\n### Get an Apple Developer Account\\n\\nOptional. You don\'t have to have Apple products to be an Apple Developer. Just go and register <https://developer.apple.com/account/>\\n\\n### Package Manager\\n\\nInstall a package manager. It optional but highly recommended. Likely your project has dependencies or you will need some utilities to configure and/or build it like `cmake` `bison` `python`.\\nThe most popular being Brew <https://brew.sh/> and the other one being <http://www.finkproject.org/>. Again less building more re-using.\\n\\n#### Must read articles:\\n* [Qt for macOS] <https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/macos.html>"}]}')}}]);
